  <p><b>September 1, 2025</b></p>

  <p>I’m excited to announce that I’ve started a new position as a Ramón y Cajal Fellow at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I look forward to contributing to the training of the next generation of telecommunication engineers and continuing my research in optical wireless communications, next-generation low-power communications, and IoT. My new findings can be found in the Publications tab. Stay tuned!</p>

  <p><b>January 20, 2025</b></p>

  <p>I’ve been awarded a prestigious Ramón y Cajal research grant to join Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, starting September 1, 2025.  The Ramón y Cajal grant is a highly competitive, nationally funded award designed to support the development of promising research careers. I’m excited to pursue my research in optical wireless communications for 6G networks.  Stay tuned for updates on my findings!</p>

  <p><b>November 2, 2024</b></p>

  <p>Our new work on visible light communications for vehicular applications titled “Colored Reconfigurable Photodetectors for Aligning the Light in Vehicular VLC” is now accessible in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology. Here we propose the concept of colored reconfigurable photodetector and we derive a novel transmission scheme referred to as colored blind interference alignment (cBIA). Our technique allows us to satisfy the requirements of 6G vehicular communications such as high data rates or a extremely low-latency.</p>

  <p><b></b></p>

  <p>Besides, we have explored the feasibility of curved mirrors to reduce the outage probability in LiFi scenarios. This work has been accepted for publication in proceedings of IEEE Globecom 2024, and it will be presented in Cape Town (South Africa) on December 9, 2024. You have a direct access to the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03378">here</a>.</p>

  <p><b>June 2, 2024</b></p>

  <p>I am very happy to announce that our paper titled “Performance analysis of VLC systems with multi-color light sources beyond RGB LEDs” has been accepted for publication in Journal of Lightwave Technology. This is a work co-authored with my colleague Dr. Alexis A. Dowhuszko. With this purpose, we offer a closed-form expression to compute the CIE 1931 tristimulus values and chromaticity coordinates of a single-color LED. Later, for the first time, we present a generalized power allocation method to precisely achieve a target white light hue of a VLC system using any tri-color LED combination. Finally, we evaluate multiple unexplored color LED combinations to study their communication and illumination performance, and we discover unexpected results! The paper is already available in the Publications section.</p>

  <p><b>January 19, 2024</b></p>

  <p>Brief update on accepted papers during last 4 months:</p>

  <p><b></b></p>

  <p>D. Frometa Fonseca, M. Sarmad Mir, S. Iglesias de Frutos, B. Genoves Guzman, D. Giustiniano, “Modulating LiFi for dual operation in the visible and infrared spectra”, accepted in Computer Communications, 2024. We here extend our prior work published in WONS 2023 with a handier prototype that offers savings in energy consumption, space and cost.</p>

  <p><b></b></p>

  <p>M. S. Mir, B. G. Guzman, A. Varshney and D. Giustiniano, “LiFi for Low-Power and Long-Range RF Backscatter”, accepted in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 2023. Extension of our prior work published in ACM Mobicom 2021. We now design and implement a novel technique for embedding multiple symbols in the RF backscatter based on delayed chirps. Experimental results with an RF carrier of 17 dBm show that we can generate RF backscatter with a range of 92.1 meters/uW consumed in the tag, which is almost double with respect to prior work.</p>

  <p><b></b></p>

  <p>D. Frometa Fonseca, B. Genovés Guzmán, G. Luca Martena, R. Bian, H. Haas, and D. Giustiniano, “A prediction-model-assisted reinforcement learning algorithm for handover decision-making in hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks”, accepted in IEEE Journal of Optical Communications and Networking, 2023. In this work we offer a handover solution in hybrid WiFi-LiFi networks. Specifically, we design a classification model to predict the type of user’s trajectory and assist a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to make handover decisions that are automatically adapted to new network conditions.</p>

  <p>Author versions are now published!</p>

  <p><b>September 2, 2023</b></p>

  <p>Brief update on accepted papers during last months:</p>

  <p><b></b></p>

  <p>M. Mir, M. Cui, B. Genoves, Q. Wang, J. Xiong, D. Giustiniano, “LeakageScatter: Backscattering LiFi-leaked RF Signals”, accepted in ACM Mobihoc, 2023. Here we explore the RF signal leaked from LiFi LED bulbs to enable power-efficient uplink RF backscatter. This means a big step to get rid of an ad-hoc carrier generator necessary (till now) for RF-backscatter, and it shows one more benefit of hybrid VLC and RF systems.</p>

  <p><b></b></p>

  <p>D. Frometa Fonseca, B. Genoves Guzman, D. Giustiniano and J. Widmer, “A System Architecture for Battery-free IoT Networks”, accepted in IEEE ICNP, 2023. Due to patent procedure, more details will be given at the time of its publication.</p>

  <p><b></b></p>

  <p>B. Genoves Guzman, M. Morales Cespedes, V.P. Gil Jimenez, A. Garcia Armada, M. Brandt-Pearce, “Optimal mirror placement to minimize the outage area in Visible Light Communication”, accepted in IEEE Globecom 2023. In this paper we explore the potential of conventional mirrors to minimize the outage probability in VLC. We determine the optimal positions depending on the required SNR, among other factors.</p>

  <p><b></b></p>

  <p>We will publish the author version of the papers very soon. Stay tuned!</p>

  <p><b>January 1, 2022</b></p>

  <p>I am glad to announce that I have just joined the University of Virginia, USA, as a postdoctoral fellow. I am funded by the European Commission to work on the Marie Curie Postdoctoral fellowship <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101061853">(RISA-VLC)</a>. During the outgoing phase of the fellowship (Jan 23 – Dec 24) I will be working at the University of Virginia (USA), and the return phase (Jan 25 - Dec 25) of the MSCA fellowship will be at the University Carlos III of Madrid (Spain). I will design RIS-based LiFi for enabling autonomous IoT devices, studying the boundaries on communication and energy harvesting. Keep posted on the results!</p>
