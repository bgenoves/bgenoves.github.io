abstract = {Multicarrier transmission schemes produce time-domain (TD) signals with large envelope fluctuations. These signals suffer from nonlinear distortions when passing through a high-power amplifier (HPA) because of its nonlinear transfer function. Several metrics are used to quantify the envelope fluctuations: peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), crest factor (CF), and cubic metric (CM). Multiple techniques and algorithms have been proposed for reducing such metrics in the literature. This article reviews all the possible PAPR reduction techniques and emphasizes the importance of their application in multicarrier schemes. Besides, new variants adapted to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are also presented, which take on importance in 5G systems. Finally, a comparison among these techniques is presented in terms of the key aspects considered when designing a 5G system: power increase, implementation complexity, bit error rate (BER) degradation, and required side information. It is shown that the selection of the PAPR reduction technique depends on the application, the system requirements, and the scenario.}

abstract={Solar cells have shown promising performance for Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer (SLIPT). Most of literature has focused on applying this concept to battery-powered high-data rate communication. Nevertheless, its application is also particularly advantageous in the low-data rate regime for battery-free systems. However, we find that using the same solar cell causes both communication and harvesting performances degradation. This problem is particularly critical in battery-free systems for its size and power constraints. This paper reveals that the reason behind this problem is that solar cells are typically operated at their Maximum Power Point (MPP), which optimizes energy harvesting but is inefficient for communication. In order to address this finding we introduce, for the first time, the Maximum Communication Point (MCP), a new operating point that complements the traditional MPP by optimizing communication performance. We then propose a transformer-based SLIPT design that enables an accurate control of the impedance at the solar cell’s output and thereby allowing precise selection of its operating point. Extensive experiments show that our system provides communication gains of 5x in peak-to-peak received voltage when operating at the MCP, and harvested power gains of more than 3x when operating at the MPP, with respect to the best performing state-of-the-art design.},

abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is a technology that complements radio frequency (RF) to fulfill the ever-increasing demand for wireless data traffic.

However, VLC deployment is hindered by blockage causing connectivity outages in the presence of obstacles. Recently, optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) have been considered to mitigate this problem. While prior works exploit ORISs for data or secrecy rate maximization, this paper studies the optimal placement of mirrors and ORISs, and the LED power allocation, for jointly minimizing the outage probability while keeping the lighting standards. We describe an optimal outage minimization framework called JointMinOut and present solvable heuristics. We provide extensive numerical results and show that the use of ORISs may reduce the outage probability by up to 67% with respect to a no-mirror scenario and provide a gain of hundreds of kbit/J in optical energy efficiency with respect to the presented benchmark.},

Although multiple-input multiple-output schemes may achieve high data rates they are subject to closed-loop transmission in order to achieve multiplexing gain, also known as degrees of freedom (DoF). In this work, we propose the concept of colored reconfigurable photodetector that generates tuples of colors each providing channel responses linearly independent among them in order to derive a novel transmission scheme referred to as colored blind interference alignment (cBIA). It gets rid of the closedloop transmission while achieving multiplexing gain, i.e., cBIA achieves both low-latency, depending on the data packet size, and high data rates. The proposed cBIA achieves three times the DoF obtained by traditional non-colored blind interference alignment (BIA). Simulations results show that the achievable rate of cBIA outperforms closed and open loop baseline schemes. Besides, cBIA satisfies the latency requirements of 6G communications.},

Multi-color light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are convenient light sources in this context, which can multiply the number of data streams with the aid of wavelength division multiplexing while providing an aggregate white light that is suitable for illumination. Although Red-Green-Blue (RGB) is the most popular combination considered in the literature for tricolor LEDs, other less explored options can also be considered to reach different illumination and communication key performance indicators in VLC systems. To carry out this analysis, an exact closed-form procedure is derived in this paper for the allocation of power per individual LED chip for any tri-color combination, which is beyond the state-of-art of the approximated methods used so far. The most convenient tri-color LED combination is also identified for providing communication and illumination services at different correlated color temperatures (CCTs). While RedOrange-Green-Blue is the most energy-efficient tri-color LED combination for illumination (in lm/W), RedOrange-Cyan-Blue is the most convenient tri-color combination to maximize the spectral efficiency for communication (in bps/Hz/W).},

Each spectrum band has its own advantages: visible light allows leveraging existing infrastructure for communication, while infrared is not affected by light dimming. In this work, we propose a modulation scheme that retains the benefits of both bands, introducing a simple, low-cost, yet efficient dimming solution for LiFi networks. We compare the performance of the proposed dimming scheme with both the digital and analog dimming techniques traditionally used in LiFi systems. Simulation results show that our dimming solution offers better communication and illumination performance than previous proposals, providing larger signal-to-noise ratio, spectral efficiency, and a full and fine-grained dimming range. Finally, we prototype our solution by designing an extended version of the OpenVLC 1.3 platform, and we experimentally show its robust communication performance under different dimming conditions.

  abstract={Light bulbs have been recently explored to design Light Fidelity (LiFi) communication to battery-free tags, thus complementing Radiofrequency (RF) backscatter in the uplink.

We introduce, a battery-free system that uses LiFi to transmit RF backscatter at a meagre power budget. We address several challenges on the system design in the LiFi transmitter, the tag and the RF receiver. We design the first LiFi transmitter that implements a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) using the visible light spectrum. We use a small bank of solar cells for both communication and harvesting, and reconfigure them based on the amount of harvested energy and desired data rate. We further alleviate the low responsiveness of solar cells with a new low-power receiver design in the tag. We design and implement a novel technique for embedding multiple symbols in the RF backscatter based on delayed chirps. Experimental results with an RF carrier of 17 dBm show that we can generate RF backscatter with a range of 92.1 meters/ μ W consumed in the tag, which is almost double with respect to prior work.},

  volume={},

  abstract={The handover process in hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets) is very challenging due to the short area covered by LiFi access points and the coverage overlap between LiFi and WiFi networks, which introduce frequent horizontal and vertical handovers, respectively. Different handover schemes have been proposed to reduce the handover rate in HLWNets, among which handover skipping (HS) techniques stand out. However, existing solutions are still inefficient or require knowledge that is not available in practice, such as the exact user's trajectory or the network topology. In this work, a novel machine learning-based handover scheme is proposed to overcome the limitations of previous HS works. Specifically, we have designed a classification model to predict the type of user's trajectory and assist a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to make handover decisions that are automatically adapted to new network conditions. The proposed scheme is called RL-HO, and we compare its performance against the standard handover scheme of long-term evolution (STD-LTE) and the so-called smart handover (Smart HO) algorithm. We show that our proposed RL-HO scheme improves the network throughput by 146\% and 59\% compared to STD-LTE and Smart HO, respectively. We make our simulator code publicly available to the research community.},

Multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) techniques can potentially achieve high data rates. However, when applied to V-VLC, they confront challenges such as the latency because of the need for closed-loop transmission or the correlation among optical channel responses. This article explains the use of blind interference alignment (BIA) for V-VLC based on the concept of a reconfigurable photodetector to provide linearly independent channel responses. It is shown that BIA solves the issues of MIMO techniques and may comply with the 6G V-VLC requirements. Besides, the vehicles are a convenient platform for implementing a reconfigurable photodetector. Finally, the open issues for BIA implementation in V-VLC are discussed to inspire future research.},

  abstract={Multi-color Light-Emitting Diode (LED) technology enables a simple approach to increase the throughput of a Visible Light Communications (VLC) system, by using Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) to transmit independent data streams on different colors. However, to compute the data rate that is achievable in such WDM VLC link, the optical power that leaks between the different colors needs to be estimated accurately, especially when low-cost optical filters are used in reception. So far, the approximations that have been reported in the literature to model the spectral power emission of different color LEDs are not good enough to perform these calculations. Starting from the theoretical spectral emission of a color LED, a closed form expression is derived based on an asymmetric Pearson type VII function, which is shown to approximate accurately the measured spectra of the color LEDs at different working regimes. In addition, the effect that the DC-bias current has on the key parameters of the approximated spectral power emissions, namely the peak and half-maximum wavelengths, as well as the peak spectral emission, are studied. Finally, a new approach is proposed to assess the level of fitness of the derived closed form approximations, using for this purpose the step-size of the MacAdam ellipses that corresponds to the different color LED spectral emissions in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram.},

ABSTRACT = {Visible light communications (VLC) have received significant attention as a way of moving part of the saturated indoor wireless traffic to the wide and unregulated visible optical spectrum. Nowadays, VLC are considered as a suitable technology, for several applications such as high-rate data transmission, supporting internet of things communications or positioning. The signal processing originally derived from radio-frequency (RF) systems such as cooperative or precoding schemes can be applied to VLC. However, its implementation is not straightforward. Furthermore, unlike RF transmission, VLC present a predominant line-of-sight link, although a weak non-LoS component may appear due to the reflection of the light on walls, floor, ceiling and nearby objects. Blocking effects may compromise the performance of the aforementioned transmission schemes. There exist several surveys in the literature focused on VLC and its applications, but the management of the shadowing and interference in VLC requires a comprehensive study. To fill this gap, this work introduces the implementation of cooperative and precoding schemes to VLC, while remarking their benefits and drawbacks for overcoming the shadowing effects. After that, the combination of both cooperative and precoding schemes is analyzed as a way of providing resilient VLC networks. Finally, we propose several open issues that the cooperative and precoding schemes must face in order to provide satisfactory VLC performance in indoor scenarios.},

This paper studies the performance of different resource allocation schemes that are suitable for multi-cell cooperative transmission when tri- and tetra-chromatic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and optical orthogonal frequency-division multiple access are utilized. Firstly, guidelines are derived for maintaining the same spatial distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in every sector of the multi-cell environment in case of stand-alone (non-cooperative) and cooperative transmission. Secondly, the possible resource allocation configurations for both stand-alone and cooperative transmission modes are identified for different LED types and available orthogonal resources (i.e., frequency sub-bands per color and sectors per cell). Finally, the data rate gain of the multiple resource allocation configurations are also analyzed, while verifying the illumination constraints. The obtained results confirm that the proper design of cooperative transmission configurations will be of paramount importance to provide reliable wireless link in ultra-dense VLC deployments.},

Thus, an alternative reflection-based cooperative wireless system concept is proposed, where no wired connections are required for connecting the APs. Then, its data rate analysis is developed based on the signal-to-noise ratio attained. The results show that the performance of the cooperative wireless system advocated closely approximates the performance of the traditional wired backhaul.

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate a novel channel estimation (CE) method for multiple-input and single-output (MISO) systems in visible light communication (VLC). Direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) is commonly used in VLC where half of the available subcarriers are spent to guarantee a real-valued output after the inverse fast Fourier transform operation. Besides, dedicated subcarriers are typically used for CE, thus, many resources are wasted and the spectral efficiency is degraded. We propose a superimposed training approach for CE in MISO DCO-OFDM VLC scenarios. Analytical expressions of mean squared error (MSE) and spectral efficiency are derived when the least squares estimator is considered. This analysis is valid for outdoor and indoor scenarios. For the CE error, simulation results of MSE show a perfect match with analytical expressions. Moreover, results prove that this technique guarantees a larger spectral efficiency than previous schemes where dedicated pilots were used. Finally, the optimal data power allocation factor is also analytically derived.},

  abstract={Visible light communication (VLC) is a promising ubiquitous design alternative for supporting high data rates.

This paper studies the feasibility of VLC in a conventional outdoor scenario, when optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing techniques are employed. The presence of sunlight reduces the system's performance, hence sophisticated adaptive techniques must be applied. Closed-form expressions of the signal-to-noise ratio and of the mean cell data rate are derived and our simulations demonstrate their accuracy. Besides, the outage probability when adaptive modulation and coding schemes are employed is analytically expressed. It is shown that, when modulation bandwidth adaptation is carried out depending on the time of day and the illuminance from ambient light, the mean cell data rate is increased and the outage probability is reduced.},

However, VLC strongly depends on the existence of a line-of-sight (LoS) link between transmitter and receiver to guarantee a good data rate performance, which is often a condition that is difficult to satisfy in practice. In this letter, a novel cooperative multicarrier transmission scheme is proposed, where neighboring attocells smartly cooperate to decrease the probability of blockage in the LoS link. This approach is compared to single-cell transmission schemes, obtaining notable gains in both received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and cell data rate when blockage of the LoS link occurs toward the nearest base station.},

  abstract={Direct current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) signals used in visible light communications suffer from high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) or cubic metric (CM). It strongly degrades the performance due to the great back-off necessary to avoid the clipping effect in the light-emitting diode. Thus, PAPR and CM reduction techniques become crucial to improve the system performance. In this paper, an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to obtain efficient DCO-OFDM signals with a low power envelope profile. First, signals specially designed for DCO-OFDM with very low CM, as the ones obtained from the raw cubic metric (RCM)-active constellation extension method, are used to train the fuzzy systems in time and frequency domains. Second, after the off-line training, the ANFIS can generate a real-valued signal in a one-shot way with 8.9 dB of RCM reduction from the original real-valued signal, which involves a gain in the input power back off larger than 2.8 dB, an illumination-to-communication conversion efficiency gain of more than 35% and considerable improvements in bit error rate.},

  abstract={Mobile communications are today widespread and contribute to the development of our society. Every day new devices include some means of wireless transmission, which is becoming ubiquitous with the Internet of Things. These systems are standardized by international organizations such as the IEEE, 3GPP, and ETSI, among others. Even though knowledge of wireless standards is key to the understanding of these systems, wireless communications are quite often taught in engineering degrees in a traditional way, without much emphasis on the standardization. Moreover, strong focus is often placed on the theoretical performance analysis rather than on practical implementation aspects. In contrast, most of the current applications make extensive use of mobile data, and the global users' satisfaction is highly correlated with the mobile data throughput. Thus, modern wireless engineers need to have deep insight on the standards that define the mobile transmission systems, and this knowledge is not acquired following the traditional theoretical teaching schemes. In this article, a new learning approach is described. This novel paradigm is based on a new flexible hardware/software platform (FRAMED-SOFT), which is also detailed. Although the article is focused on two wireless standards, GSM and UMTS, the work discussed in this article can easily be extended to other standards of interest, such as LTE and beyond, WiFi, and WiMAX.},

  abstract={In this paper, a novel cooperative transmission and reception scheme in Visible Light Communications (VLC) is proposed and evaluated. This new scheme provides improvements and reliability in large indoor scenarios, such as corridors, laboratories, shops or conference rooms, where the coverage needs to be obtained by using different access points when VLC is used. The main idea behind the proposal is a simple cooperative transmission scheme where the receiver terminal will obtain the signal from different access points at the same time. This proposal outperforms traditional VLC schemes, especially in Non-Line-of-Sight reception where around 3 dB of gain, with respect to traditional schemes, can be obtained for unoptimized parameters, and larger than 3 dB could easily be achieved. The cooperation is studied in terms of the percentage of light coming from the main access point and a parameter called sidelobes' amplitude level. The performance is evaluated according to the location within the atto-cell.},

abstract={Visible light communication (VLC) complements radio frequency in indoor environments with large wireless data traffic. However, VLC is hindered by dramatic path losses when an opaque object is interposed between the transmitter and the receiver. Prior works propose the use of plane mirrors as optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) to enhance communications through non-line-of-sight links. Plane mirrors rely on their orientation to forward the light to the target user location, which is challenging to implement in practice. This paper studies the potential of curved mirrors as static reflective surfaces to provide a broadening specular reflection that increases the signal coverage in mirror-assisted VLC scenarios. We study the behavior of paraboloid and semi-spherical mirrors and derive the irradiance equations. We provide extensive numerical and analytical results and show that curved mirrors, when developed with proper dimensions, may reduce the shadowing probability to zero, while static plane mirrors of the same size have shadowing probabilities larger than 65%. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio offered by curved mirrors may suffice to provide connectivity to users deployed in the room even when a line-of-sight link blockage occurs.},

abstract={Visible light communication (VLC) is a growing technology that can complement radio frequency to fulfill the increasing demand for wireless data services. VLC exploits the already deployed illumination infrastructure based on light-emitting diodes to communicate data. While mirrors have been traditionally used for interior decoration, among other applications, to what extent can they be deployed to improve VLC performance? In this paper, we propose optimizing the placement of mirrors to minimize the outage area, a common problem in VLC when line-of-sight link blockage occurs. We compare this optimal performance with a single-rectangular mirror array, a common mirror shape that is found indoors. We also study the most helpful mirror placement under different conditions. We show that our outage minimization algorithm, MinOut, easily provides threefold outage reductions. Besides, we demonstrate that a single-rectangular mirror array with orientation mobility can provide similar or even better performance than an optimal distributed mirror placement without mobility.},

Backscatter systems either rely on active signal generators (spectrum efficient, but dedicated infrastructure) or existing ambient wireless transmissions (existing infrastructure, but spectrum inefficient). In this paper, we aim to make RF backscatter spectrum efficient and at the same time work with existing infrastructure. We propose to leverage the deployment of LiFi networks built upon LED bulbs for pervasive RF backscatter. We experimentally demonstrate that LiFi, which passively leaks RF signals, can be exploited as a radio carrier generator for low-power RF backscatter. We further design LeakageScatter, the first backscatter system operating in the ISM band and exploiting LiFi-leaked RF signals, without the need to actively generate the carrier wave. We customize the design of the loop at the LiFi transmitter, as well as the coil antennas at the tag and RF backscatter receiver, to optimize the system performance. We propose to opportunistically enable the oscillator of the backscatter tag in the software that could reduce the energy consumption on backscattering by up to 75\%. Experimental results show that LeakageScatter achieves a backscattering distance up to 10 m and 18 m in indoor and outdoor scenarios, respectively, without using a dedicated RF carrier generator.},

Then, we validate such tool by considering an example scenario with fixed positions and orientations, including increasing number of users in an indoor LiFi network using WD. In order to better clarify the interference contributions to the quality of service provided, we consider the first user as reference, and evaluate how the presence of progressively higher number of users in its vicinity impacts the interference that the main user is experiencing. We then analyse how the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, interference-to-noise ratio and signal-to-interference ratio figures of the main user change depending on how many interfering users are included in the considered scenario.},

In order to improve the communication range, we propose to exploit the full non-linear region of an LED transceiver while maintaining constant illumination. We show that working in the full LED region can provide received electrical power gains in the mobile IoT tag of around 15 dB. We achieve this without affecting the communication rate for IoT applications, and at the penalty of about 10% increase in the total energy consumption of LEDs. We further demonstrate that exploiting the non-linear region of LEDs is beneficial for mobile tags that employ a solar cell for receiving data at high data rates.},

  abstract={Light-based positioning systems (LPS) are gaining significant attention as a means to provide localization with cm accuracy. Many of these systems estimate the object position based on the received light intensity, and work properly in `ideal' environments such as large open spaces without obstructions around the light-emitting diode (LED) and the receiver, where reflections are negligible. In more dynamic environments, such as indoor spaces with moving people and city roads with moving vehicles, materials cause a wide variety of reflections. This causes variations in the received light intensity and, as a consequence, gross localization errors in LPS. We propose a new multipath detection technique for improving LPS that does not require the knowledge of the channel impulse response and then, it is suited to be implemented in low-cost positioning receivers that use a single-pixel photodetector. To develop our technique, we (i) analyze the statistical properties of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components, (ii) develop an automated testbed to study the reflections of different types of surfaces and materials, and (iii) design an algorithm to remove the NLOS components affecting the positioning estimate. Our experimental evaluation shows that, in complex environments, our methodology can reduce the localization error using LEDs up to 93%.},

The forthcoming Industry 4.0 requires reliable high-speed communication links, which can be easily fulfilled with the massive adoption of the VLC technology. However, in VLC indoor communication environments, line-of-sight link blockages and strong misalignment losses between the light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters and the photodiode (PD) receivers are usual problems that must be tackled. This paper proposes a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission technique to deal with both issues, and carries out a detailed evaluation of the VLC system performance as function of the PD receiver orientation and the density of obstacles in different scenarios. The proposed cooperative transmission scheme demonstrates an improvement in the average cell data rate and outage probability performance and, as a consequence, justifies the use of CoMP techniques to provide reliable VLC services in ultra-dense small cell scenarios indoors.},

  abstract={Rescue tasks in coal mines are fundamental but often suppose the loss of rescuers lives, as currently they are carried out only by humans. TeleRescuer project expects to make this activity safer by developing a robot to be driven by rescuers from a safe area. It offers virtual teleportation providing to the operator an environment where he can interact with the reality perceived by the robot. In this paper, the design of the communication, vision and sensory systems are presented, giving an overview of all the elements that are included in the robot. The adaptation of these electronics to the hazardous environment is also explained. A prototype of an ad-hoc wireless network and results in terms of the transmission characteristics are shown.},

  year={2017},

  abstract={Terahertz (THz) band communication has abundant spectral resources to accommodate multiple broadband carriers. However, the strong path loss attenuation and the limited transmission power affect the maximum number of carriers that can be activated. A simple way to address this limitation consists in transmitting the same message from multiple transmission points, using Joint-Transmission (JT) Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP). However, the distance-frequency-dependent molecular absorption that THz channels experience makes the implementation of JT-CoMP challenging. In this paper, we propose a decentralized scheme that takes into account the effect of distance to select the per-carrier transmit beamforming weights and powers. For this purpose, low-rate feedback information is reported from the receiver to the transmission points, such that decisions performed locally take into account the ones made in the coordinated set. Notable sum data rate gains are observed when compared to the baseline schemes, where transmission power is equally divided among carriers or independently allocated using waterfilling. As expected, the accuracy of the reported channel phase information, the number active transmission points, and the distance-dependent frequency selectivity of the THz channel affect the sum data rate that multi-carrier JT-CoMP can provide.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={240-245},
  abstract={Visible Light Communications (VLC) is considered one of the most promising technologies to guarantee the future demand of user wireless data rate. Since a DC value is needed for illumination, Direct Current-biased Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) is adopted as modulation technique in these environments. Channel estimation in VLC is quite different from the conventional radiofrequency (RF) counterparts because the indoor optical wireless channel model significantly differs from the traditional RF one. Previous proposals rely on dedicated pilot symbols to perform channel estimation what leads to a loss in efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of Superimposed Training (ST) for channel estimation in VLC scenarios.},
