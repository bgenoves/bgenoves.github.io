abstract = {Multicarrier transmission schemes produce time-domain (TD) signals with large envelope fluctuations. These signals suffer from nonlinear distortions when passing through a high-power amplifier (HPA) because of its nonlinear transfer function. Several metrics are used to quantify the envelope fluctuations: peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), crest factor (CF), and cubic metric (CM). Multiple techniques and algorithms have been proposed for reducing such metrics in the literature. This article reviews all the possible PAPR reduction techniques and emphasizes the importance of their application in multicarrier schemes. Besides, new variants adapted to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are also presented, which take on importance in 5G systems. Finally, a comparison among these techniques is presented in terms of the key aspects considered when designing a 5G system: power increase, implementation complexity, bit error rate (BER) degradation, and required side information. It is shown that the selection of the PAPR reduction technique depends on the application, the system requirements, and the scenario.}

abstract = {Light-Fidelity (LiFi) has emerged in the last few years as a promising technology for alleviating the stringent demand for wireless data services. Prior works have considered LiFi operating either in the visible light or infrared spectrum. Each spectrum band has its own advantages: visible light allows leveraging existing infrastructure for communication, while infrared is not affected by light dimming. In this work, we propose a modulation scheme that retains the benefits of both bands, introducing a simple, low-cost, yet efficient dimming solution for LiFi networks. We compare the performance of the proposed dimming scheme with both the digital and analog dimming techniques traditionally used in LiFi systems. Simulation results show that our dimming solution offers better communication and illumination performance than previous proposals, providing larger signal-to-noise ratio, spectral efficiency, and a full and fine-grained dimming range. Finally, we prototype our solution by designing an extended version of the OpenVLC 1.3 platform, and we experimentally show its robust communication performance under different dimming conditions. We make the implemented system publicly available to the research community.}

In this paper, we show that LiFi and RF backscatter are complementary and have unexplored interactions. We introduce, a battery-free system that uses LiFi to transmit RF backscatter at a meagre power budget. We address several challenges on the system design in the LiFi transmitter, the tag and the RF receiver. We design the first LiFi transmitter that implements a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) using the visible light spectrum. We use a small bank of solar cells for both communication and harvesting, and reconfigure them based on the amount of harvested energy and desired data rate. We further alleviate the low responsiveness of solar cells with a new low-power receiver design in the tag. We design and implement a novel technique for embedding multiple symbols in the RF backscatter based on delayed chirps. Experimental results with an RF carrier of 17 dBm show that we can generate RF backscatter with a range of 92.1 meters/ μ W consumed in the tag, which is almost double with respect to prior work.},

  abstract={The handover process in hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets) is very challenging due to the short area covered by LiFi access points and the coverage overlap between LiFi and WiFi networks, which introduce frequent horizontal and vertical handovers, respectively. Different handover schemes have been proposed to reduce the handover rate in HLWNets, among which handover skipping (HS) techniques stand out. However, existing solutions are still inefficient or require knowledge that is not available in practice, such as the exact user's trajectory or the network topology. In this work, a novel machine learning-based handover scheme is proposed to overcome the limitations of previous HS works. Specifically, we have designed a classification model to predict the type of user's trajectory and assist a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to make handover decisions that are automatically adapted to new network conditions. The proposed scheme is called RL-HO, and we compare its performance against the standard handover scheme of long-term evolution (STD-LTE) and the so-called smart handover (Smart HO) algorithm. We show that our proposed RL-HO scheme improves the network throughput by 146\% and 59\% compared to STD-LTE and Smart HO, respectively. We make our simulator code publicly available to the research community.},

A common experimental platform is necessary to lower the entrance barriers of VLC and speed up the research development. In this paper, we provide guidelines for prototyping VLC for IoT applications, assisted by the open-source platform OpenVLC.

Leveraging the need for artificial light in greenhouses when the natural sunlight available is not sufficient, we envision that recent progress in Internet of Things (IoT) technology, together with novel Light-Fidelity (LiFi)-based methods have the potential to significantly reduce energy and resources used in food production. In this paper we describe our work towards sustainable and precision greenhouses by using LiFi-enabled IoT. Here we present a battery-free wireless network of IoT sensor nodes that exploit LiFi for both communication and power harvesting, while monitoring environmental conditions for optimal greenhouse operation and plant production.

abstract = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are one of the most promising 6G scenarios. However, V2V communications demand high data rates and extremely low-latency requirements that are difficult to satisfy nowadays. Recently, vehicular visible light communications (V-VLC) have been proposed as a promising technology to guarantee such requirements. Multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) techniques can potentially achieve high data rates. However, when applied to V-VLC, they confront challenges such as the latency because of the need for closed-loop transmission or the correlation among optical channel responses. This article explains the use of blind interference alignment (BIA) for V-VLC based on the concept of a reconfigurable photodetector to provide linearly independent channel responses. It is shown that BIA solves the issues of MIMO techniques and may comply with the 6G V-VLC requirements. Besides, the vehicles are a convenient platform for implementing a reconfigurable photodetector. Finally, the open issues for BIA implementation in V-VLC are discussed to inspire future research.},

  abstract={Multi-color Light-Emitting Diode (LED) technology enables a simple approach to increase the throughput of a Visible Light Communications (VLC) system, by using Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) to transmit independent data streams on different colors. However, to compute the data rate that is achievable in such WDM VLC link, the optical power that leaks between the different colors needs to be estimated accurately, especially when low-cost optical filters are used in reception. So far, the approximations that have been reported in the literature to model the spectral power emission of different color LEDs are not good enough to perform these calculations. Starting from the theoretical spectral emission of a color LED, a closed form expression is derived based on an asymmetric Pearson type VII function, which is shown to approximate accurately the measured spectra of the color LEDs at different working regimes. In addition, the effect that the DC-bias current has on the key parameters of the approximated spectral power emissions, namely the peak and half-maximum wavelengths, as well as the peak spectral emission, are studied. Finally, a new approach is proposed to assess the level of fitness of the derived closed form approximations, using for this purpose the step-size of the MacAdam ellipses that corresponds to the different color LED spectral emissions in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram.},

ABSTRACT = {Visible light communications (VLC) have received significant attention as a way of moving part of the saturated indoor wireless traffic to the wide and unregulated visible optical spectrum. Nowadays, VLC are considered as a suitable technology, for several applications such as high-rate data transmission, supporting internet of things communications or positioning. The signal processing originally derived from radio-frequency (RF) systems such as cooperative or precoding schemes can be applied to VLC. However, its implementation is not straightforward. Furthermore, unlike RF transmission, VLC present a predominant line-of-sight link, although a weak non-LoS component may appear due to the reflection of the light on walls, floor, ceiling and nearby objects. Blocking effects may compromise the performance of the aforementioned transmission schemes. There exist several surveys in the literature focused on VLC and its applications, but the management of the shadowing and interference in VLC requires a comprehensive study. To fill this gap, this work introduces the implementation of cooperative and precoding schemes to VLC, while remarking their benefits and drawbacks for overcoming the shadowing effects. After that, the combination of both cooperative and precoding schemes is analyzed as a way of providing resilient VLC networks. Finally, we propose several open issues that the cooperative and precoding schemes must face in order to provide satisfactory VLC performance in indoor scenarios.},

  abstract={Visible light communication (VLC) often suffers from line-of-sight path blockages and high levels of inter-cell interference. Thus, the analysis and design of cooperation techniques become crucial to address these key impairments. This paper studies the performance of different resource allocation schemes that are suitable for multi-cell cooperative transmission when tri- and tetra-chromatic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and optical orthogonal frequency-division multiple access are utilized. Firstly, guidelines are derived for maintaining the same spatial distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in every sector of the multi-cell environment in case of stand-alone (non-cooperative) and cooperative transmission. Secondly, the possible resource allocation configurations for both stand-alone and cooperative transmission modes are identified for different LED types and available orthogonal resources (i.e., frequency sub-bands per color and sectors per cell). Finally, the data rate gain of the multiple resource allocation configurations are also analyzed, while verifying the illumination constraints. The obtained results confirm that the proper design of cooperative transmission configurations will be of paramount importance to provide reliable wireless link in ultra-dense VLC deployments.},

  abstract={Visible light communication (VLC) is capable of satisfying the escalating data rate demand in indoor scenarios. The lighting infrastructure may also be exploited in the downlink of a wireless local area network (WLAN), where light-emitting diodes are used for transmitting information. The backhaul of VLC access points (APs) constitutes a potential bottleneck in WLANs, especially in large rooms where the number of APs is high. Thus, an alternative reflection-based cooperative wireless system concept is proposed, where no wired connections are required for connecting the APs. Then, its data rate analysis is developed based on the signal-to-noise ratio attained. The results show that the performance of the cooperative wireless system advocated closely approximates the performance of the traditional wired backhaul. Finally, we demonstrate by using Jain's index of fairness that the proposed scheme provides fair coverage quality for all users.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate a novel channel estimation (CE) method for multiple-input and single-output (MISO) systems in visible light communication (VLC). Direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) is commonly used in VLC where half of the available subcarriers are spent to guarantee a real-valued output after the inverse fast Fourier transform operation. Besides, dedicated subcarriers are typically used for CE, thus, many resources are wasted and the spectral efficiency is degraded. We propose a superimposed training approach for CE in MISO DCO-OFDM VLC scenarios. Analytical expressions of mean squared error (MSE) and spectral efficiency are derived when the least squares estimator is considered. This analysis is valid for outdoor and indoor scenarios. For the CE error, simulation results of MSE show a perfect match with analytical expressions. Moreover, results prove that this technique guarantees a larger spectral efficiency than previous schemes where dedicated pilots were used. Finally, the optimal data power allocation factor is also analytically derived.},

  abstract={Visible light communication (VLC) is a promising ubiquitous design alternative for supporting high data rates. Its application has been primarily oriented to indoor scenarios, but the proliferation of light-emitting diodes in the streets warrants its investigation in outdoor scenarios as well. This paper studies the feasibility of VLC in a conventional outdoor scenario, when optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing techniques are employed. The presence of sunlight reduces the system's performance, hence sophisticated adaptive techniques must be applied. Closed-form expressions of the signal-to-noise ratio and of the mean cell data rate are derived and our simulations demonstrate their accuracy. Besides, the outage probability when adaptive modulation and coding schemes are employed is analytically expressed. It is shown that, when modulation bandwidth adaptation is carried out depending on the time of day and the illuminance from ambient light, the mean cell data rate is increased and the outage probability is reduced.},

  abstract={Direct current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) signals used in visible light communications suffer from high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) or cubic metric (CM). It strongly degrades the performance due to the great back-off necessary to avoid the clipping effect in the light-emitting diode. Thus, PAPR and CM reduction techniques become crucial to improve the system performance. In this paper, an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to obtain efficient DCO-OFDM signals with a low power envelope profile. First, signals specially designed for DCO-OFDM with very low CM, as the ones obtained from the raw cubic metric (RCM)-active constellation extension method, are used to train the fuzzy systems in time and frequency domains. Second, after the off-line training, the ANFIS can generate a real-valued signal in a one-shot way with 8.9 dB of RCM reduction from the original real-valued signal, which involves a gain in the input power back off larger than 2.8 dB, an illumination-to-communication conversion efficiency gain of more than 35% and considerable improvements in bit error rate.},

  abstract={Mobile communications are today widespread and contribute to the development of our society. Every day new devices include some means of wireless transmission, which is becoming ubiquitous with the Internet of Things. These systems are standardized by international organizations such as the IEEE, 3GPP, and ETSI, among others. Even though knowledge of wireless standards is key to the understanding of these systems, wireless communications are quite often taught in engineering degrees in a traditional way, without much emphasis on the standardization. Moreover, strong focus is often placed on the theoretical performance analysis rather than on practical implementation aspects. In contrast, most of the current applications make extensive use of mobile data, and the global users' satisfaction is highly correlated with the mobile data throughput. Thus, modern wireless engineers need to have deep insight on the standards that define the mobile transmission systems, and this knowledge is not acquired following the traditional theoretical teaching schemes. In this article, a new learning approach is described. This novel paradigm is based on a new flexible hardware/software platform (FRAMED-SOFT), which is also detailed. Although the article is focused on two wireless standards, GSM and UMTS, the work discussed in this article can easily be extended to other standards of interest, such as LTE and beyond, WiFi, and WiMAX.},

The main idea behind the proposal is a simple cooperative transmission scheme where the receiver terminal will obtain the signal from different access points at the same time. This proposal outperforms traditional VLC schemes, especially in Non-Line-of-Sight reception where around 3 dB of gain, with respect to traditional schemes, can be obtained for unoptimized parameters, and larger than 3 dB could easily be achieved. The cooperation is studied in terms of the percentage of light coming from the main access point and a parameter called sidelobes' amplitude level. The performance is evaluated according to the location within the atto-cell.},

abstract={Visible light communication (VLC) is a growing technology that can complement radio frequency to fulfill the increasing demand for wireless data services. VLC exploits the already deployed illumination infrastructure based on light-emitting diodes to communicate data. While mirrors have been traditionally used for interior decoration, among other applications, to what extent can they be deployed to improve VLC performance? In this paper, we propose optimizing the placement of mirrors to minimize the outage area, a common problem in VLC when line-of-sight link blockage occurs. We compare this optimal performance with a single-rectangular mirror array, a common mirror shape that is found indoors. We also study the most helpful mirror placement under different conditions. We show that our outage minimization algorithm, MinOut, easily provides threefold outage reductions.

abstract={While much research effort has been invested in long-range and low-power uplink communication for battery-free IoT networks, current deployments lack a scalable bidirectional communication infrastructure for data collection and processing with battery-free devices. To fill this gap, we introduce Lo W-Fi, a system architecture specifically designed to meet the requirements of battery-free IoT applications. We show the suitability of LoW-Fi for deploying monitoring systems for precision agriculture indoors. This sector is revolutionizing with the installation of smart greenhouses that require the constant monitoring of ambient parameters to ensure optimal conditions for the crops growth. Our system is implemented using commercial off-the-shelf devices, and it works at the intersection of WiFi and LiFi for downlink and RF backscatter for uplink, retaining the advantages of each technology and solving their practical limitations. We evaluate LoW-Fi performance in a real greenhouse, and the experimental results show that it can achieve an uplink (downlink) range of 45m(70m) with 0% BER. The aggregated data rate is up to 4.5 Mb/s.},

abstract = {Radio-Frequency (RF) backscatter has emerged as a low-power communication technique. Backscatter systems either rely on active signal generators (spectrum efficient, but dedicated infrastructure) or existing ambient wireless transmissions (existing infrastructure, but spectrum inefficient). In this paper, we aim to make RF backscatter spectrum efficient and at the same time work with existing infrastructure. We propose to leverage the deployment of LiFi networks built upon LED bulbs for pervasive RF backscatter. We experimentally demonstrate that LiFi, which passively leaks RF signals, can be exploited as a radio carrier generator for low-power RF backscatter. We further design LeakageScatter, the first backscatter system operating in the ISM band and exploiting LiFi-leaked RF signals, without the need to actively generate the carrier wave. We customize the design of the loop at the LiFi transmitter, as well as the coil antennas at the tag and RF backscatter receiver, to optimize the system performance. We propose to opportunistically enable the oscillator of the backscatter tag in the software that could reduce the energy consumption on backscattering by up to 75\%. Experimental results show that LeakageScatter achieves a backscattering distance up to 10 m and 18 m in indoor and outdoor scenarios, respectively, without using a dedicated RF carrier generator.},

Then, we validate such tool by considering an example scenario with fixed positions and orientations, including increasing number of users in an indoor LiFi network using WD. In order to better clarify the interference contributions to the quality of service provided, we consider the first user as reference, and evaluate how the presence of progressively higher number of users in its vicinity impacts the interference that the main user is experiencing. We then analyse how the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, interference-to-noise ratio and signal-to-interference ratio figures of the main user change depending on how many interfering users are included in the considered scenario.},

In this work, we propose a modulation scheme that efficiently uses both spectra, and present a simple, low cost, yet efficient modulation technique that retains the benefits of both bands. We prototype our solution by creating an extended version of OpenVLC, and we experimentally show its robust performance in communication under different dimming conditions.

We can achieve a bandwidth in the order of 50 kHz and distances of around 3.5 m using commercial RGB LED bulbs as transceivers, without using any dedicated photodetector. RGB LED links are composed of three main colours, and we show that red is the best colour both for communicating to another receiving RGB LED bulb, as well as for harvesting with a solar cell; green and blue can instead be exploited for standard-compliant lighting and/or sensing purposes. We evaluate the system in two proof of concepts and provide insights for operating RGB LEDs for multiple tasks.},

In this paper, we show that LiFi and RF backscatter are complementary and have unexplored interactions. We introduce PassiveLiFi, a battery-free system that uses LiFi to transmit RF backscatter at a meagre power budget. We address several challenges on the system design in the LiFi transmitter, the tag and the RF receiver. We design the first LiFi transmitter that implements a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) using the visible light spectrum. We use a small bank of solar cells for communication and harvesting and reconfigure them based on the amount of harvested energy and desired data rate. We further alleviate the low responsiveness of solar cells with a new low-power receiver design in the tag. Experimental results with an RF carrier of 17 dBm show that we can generate RF backscatter with a range of 80.3 meters/μW consumed in the tag, which is almost double with respect to prior work.},

The generalized idea of modulating the signal within the light-emitting diode (LED) linear region is considered the de-facto approach for high-speed communication. This paper shows that this is not the most appropriate choice for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where the communication range is of greater importance once a sufficient communication rate is reached. In order to improve the communication range, we propose to exploit the full non-linear region of an LED transceiver while maintaining constant illumination. We show that working in the full LED region can provide received electrical power gains in the mobile IoT tag of around 15 dB. We achieve this without affecting the communication rate for IoT applications, and at the penalty of about 10% increase in the total energy consumption of LEDs. We further demonstrate that exploiting the non-linear region of LEDs is beneficial for mobile tags that employ a solar cell for receiving data at high data rates.},

  abstract={Light-based positioning systems (LPS) are gaining significant attention as a means to provide localization with cm accuracy. Many of these systems estimate the object position based on the received light intensity, and work properly in `ideal' environments such as large open spaces without obstructions around the light-emitting diode (LED) and the receiver, where reflections are negligible. In more dynamic environments, such as indoor spaces with moving people and city roads with moving vehicles, materials cause a wide variety of reflections. This causes variations in the received light intensity and, as a consequence, gross localization errors in LPS. We propose a new multipath detection technique for improving LPS that does not require the knowledge of the channel impulse response and then, it is suited to be implemented in low-cost positioning receivers that use a single-pixel photodetector. To develop our technique, we (i) analyze the statistical properties of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components, (ii) develop an automated testbed to study the reflections of different types of surfaces and materials, and (iii) design an algorithm to remove the NLOS components affecting the positioning estimate. Our experimental evaluation shows that, in complex environments, our methodology can reduce the localization error using LEDs up to 93%.},

The forthcoming Industry 4.0 requires reliable high-speed communication links, which can be easily fulfilled with the massive adoption of the VLC technology. However, in VLC indoor communication environments, line-of-sight link blockages and strong misalignment losses between the light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters and the photodiode (PD) receivers are usual problems that must be tackled. This paper proposes a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission technique to deal with both issues, and carries out a detailed evaluation of the VLC system performance as function of the PD receiver orientation and the density of obstacles in different scenarios. The proposed cooperative transmission scheme demonstrates an improvement in the average cell data rate and outage probability performance and, as a consequence, justifies the use of CoMP techniques to provide reliable VLC services in ultra-dense small cell scenarios indoors.},

  abstract={Terahertz (THz) band communication has abundant spectral resources to accommodate multiple broadband carriers. However, the strong path loss attenuation and the limited transmission power affect the maximum number of carriers that can be activated. A simple way to address this limitation consists in transmitting the same message from multiple transmission points, using Joint-Transmission (JT) Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP). However, the distance-frequency-dependent molecular absorption that THz channels experience makes the implementation of JT-CoMP challenging. In this paper, we propose a decentralized scheme that takes into account the effect of distance to select the per-carrier transmit beamforming weights and powers. For this purpose, low-rate feedback information is reported from the receiver to the transmission points, such that decisions performed locally take into account the ones made in the coordinated set. Notable sum data rate gains are observed when compared to the baseline schemes, where transmission power is equally divided among carriers or independently allocated using waterfilling. As expected, the accuracy of the reported channel phase information, the number active transmission points, and the distance-dependent frequency selectivity of the THz channel affect the sum data rate that multi-carrier JT-CoMP can provide.},
